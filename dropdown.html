            <h1>Dropdown character selector</h1>
            <p>After much anticipation, Duolingo <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/comment/24786078">recently released their Japanese 
            beta course to desktop users</a> following a redesign of their website to 
            be more consistent with their mobile app. 
            <br><br>This was met with mixed reviews since the redesign bought in the 
            somewhat unpopular tile selection exercises where the user is asked to translate
            a phrase and are given a limited set of words to choose from in order to do so.
            <br><br>I don't particularly mind it but I understand why it's unpopular 
            (offers the user less motivation/opportunity to recall) and also why the
            people behind Duolingo may have gone down this route (better parity with their
            mobile app means, in future, courses can be made for one and work for both. 
            Also, I suspect they may anticipate that some people could be put off/otherwise hindered
            by the 'entry requirement' of having to download the target language keyboard)
            <br><br>Here I have a simple demo of a possible solution to the latter issue [<a href="https://github.com/Fox-Islam/dropdown-selector">Github link</a>].</p>

            <h2>How to use this thing</h2>
            <p>Type the pronunciation of a Japanese character (for example, 'tsu') into the input 
            field and can select from a list of matching Japanese characters (for 'tsu' the 
            options would be ツ, ッ, つ, っ) by using the up/down arrow keys, pressing enter once you find what you're looking for.
            <br>To access つ one may type '/tsu' or just 'ts' followed by two presses of the 
            down arrow key or even 't' followed by six presses of the down arrow key and then press enter.
            </p>
            <div class="dropdown">
                <input id="searchTxt" placeholder="Use up and down arrows to navigate and press enter to select">

            <div>
                <p>With the exception of ッ, っ, and ー (which, here, are accessed with 'tsu','tsu' and '-' respectively)
                all the pronunciation pairs can be found on my <a href="tooltips.html">character tooltips page</a>. </p>
                <p> Additionally there are a variety of available punctuation characters: </p>
